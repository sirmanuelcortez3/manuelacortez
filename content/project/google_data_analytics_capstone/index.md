Summary: The Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Specialization
Title: Analysis Of 2019 Cyclistic Bike Share Data
---
The project scenario consists of being hired as a junior data analyst on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The main objective was to understand the differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. By analyzing data on ride frequency, duration, and popular routes, I identified key trends that explained why casual riders might consider upgrading to annual memberships. The insights I gathered were instrumental in designing targeted marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into loyal annual members. My findings were presented to Cyclistic executives, backed by compelling data visualizations and actionable recommendations. The main tool that was used in this analysis was R.
