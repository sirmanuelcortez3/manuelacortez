summary: Creation and Queries to a University and Banking Database
title: University Banking Database
---
In this project, I applied database design and query development skills to create and manage a banking database for a University's Bank Holdings. The first part involved designing the database schema, where I defined primary and foreign keys, implemented constraints, and ensured data integrity through a comprehensive Data Definition Language (DDL). After populating the database with provided data, I wrote and tested a series of complex queries utilizing JOINs, SET operators, and subqueries. Additionally, I developed advanced queries for a university's student database, further applying SQL concepts that meet specific data retrieval and analysis needs.
