Summary: The Final Project for the Python 3 Programming course from the University of Michigan
Title: Python 3 Programming Project
---
In this project, a ZIP file containing newspaper images were processed. The goal was to develop a Python program capable of searching these images for specific keywords and detecting faces associated with those keywords. To achieve this, I applied several Python libraries, including Pillow for image manipulation, OpenCV for face detection, and Pytesseract for optical character recognition (OCR). The project involved creating a contact sheet of all faces found on newspaper pages that mentioned the search term. This comprehensive project tested my ability to learn new tools, integrate multiple libraries, and solve complex problems in image processing.
