summary: The Final Project to the Scripting and Programming Applications Course
title: Class Roster Project
---
The project scenario consists of being hired as a contractor to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform using C++ language. My primary responsibility was to develop a program that included two key classes: Student and Roster. This program was designed to manage the current roster of students enrolled in a course. It involved reading student data, including ID, name, email, age, course completion times, and degree program, and using function calls to manipulate this data. As the data was parsed, the program created student objects and stored the entire student list in an array called `classRosterArray`. The program provided specific outputs directly to the console, ensuring accurate and efficient data management throughout the migration process.
